# taxi-driver-with-java
A project used to find a taxi in a city. A client in a given position wants to order a taxi, and the program tries to find the best taxi available (the closest one to the client) to be sent to the client. When the best taxi is found, then the route is visualized. The project was implemented in Java using the A* algorithm combined with the Beam Search algorithm, as well as the Google Maps API for the visualization.
